# SQL_Challenge
The repository "SQL_Chalenge" focuses on practicing SQL skills through real-world case studies, as part of the 8-week challenge created by Danny Ma. This project is designed to help learners sharpen their SQL skills and build a stronger understanding of how to handle real-life data analysis tasks.
