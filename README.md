# SQL_Chalenge

Welcome to my SQL learning journey! This repository is part of the **8 Week SQL Challenge** created by Danny Ma. The project is designed to help me practice and improve my SQL skills through real-world case studies. Each week, I will tackle a new challenge to deepen my understanding of SQL and enhance my ability to solve data-related problems.
